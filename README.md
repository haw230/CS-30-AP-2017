# EggZag
This is a repository for the EggZag project's development assets. This is a runner style game originally developed by Red Meat Games. E-Link Entertainment took over development in mid 2015, relaunching the project as Egg Zag: Endless Arcade Roller.

In many way this project is our testing ground for working out publishing pipelines and 3rd party package integration that may be used in future projects.

# ProTip show hidden files to see the .git folder in this directory :D
